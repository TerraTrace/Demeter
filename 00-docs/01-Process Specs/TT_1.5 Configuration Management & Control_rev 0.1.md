# TT_1.5 Configuration Management & Control

**Version:** 0.1  
**Date:** June 12, 2025  
**Status:** Initial Draft  
**Parent Document:** TT1.0 Process Spec v0.2

## 1. Introduction and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
This specification defines configuration management practices that support the software-first spacecraft development philosophy established in TT_1.0. The CM framework manages the complete software ecosystem from AI-driven design processes through automated manufacturing and software-centric flight vehicles.

### 1.2 Relationship to TT_1.0
TT_1.0 establishes three pillars of software-centricity: software-driven development processes, software-centric vehicle architecture, and automated design-to-manufacturing pipelines. This specification implements the configuration management practices necessary to control and coordinate these interconnected software systems while maintaining aerospace-grade traceability and quality.

### 1.3 Configuration Management Implications
The software-centric approach creates unique CM challenges that require adaptation of traditional aerospace configuration management:

**Multi-Domain Software Integration:**
- AI workflow software that generates requirements and designs
- Flight software that implements spacecraft functionality
- CAD software that automatically generates manufacturing models
- Manufacturing software that controls fabrication processes
- Ground software that operates the completed spacecraft

**End-to-End Traceability Requirements:**
- Version synchronization across the entire software pipeline
- Change impact analysis spanning from mission requirements to flight operations
- Automated linking between design decisions and manufacturing instructions
- Software-hardware interface definition and control

**Automated Process Control:**
- Configuration management of AI-generated artifacts
- Quality assurance of automated CAD model generation
- Version control of manufacturing instruction generation
- Flight software configuration management and over-the-air updates

**Rapid Iteration Management:**
- Support for accelerated design-simulate-test-refine cycles
- Concurrent development across multiple software domains
- Real-time impact assessment of changes across the software ecosystem
- Baseline management for rapidly evolving software-defined systems

### 1.4 Scope
This specification covers configuration management practices for framework and mission repository architecture, version control strategies, configuration item identification, baseline management, change control processes, and integration with the CM sub-specifications detailed in Section 2.

## 2. CM Sub-Specification Framework

The following sub-specifications provide detailed implementation guidance for specific aspects of configuration management:

1. **TT_1.5.1 Program Unique Identifiers** - LLM-optimized naming conventions database with PUI registry and validation rules
2. **TT_1.5.2 Software Coding Standards** - Development standards for AI workflows, flight software, and automated tools
3. **TT_1.5.3 Data Format Standards** - YAML/JSON schemas for requirements, designs, and interface definitions
4. **TT_1.5.4 Documentation Standards** - Markdown templates, style guides, and automated documentation generation
5. **TT_1.5.5 Automated Quality Assurance** - CI/CD pipelines, validation workflows, and automated testing frameworks
6. **TT_1.5.6 Traceability Management** - Automated linking systems, audit trails, and impact analysis tools

*Additional CM sub-specifications will be added as the framework matures.*

## 3. Repository Architecture

### 3.1 Framework-Mission Separation Strategy
The CM system maintains strict separation between the reusable framework and mission-specific implementations:

**Framework Repository (spacecraft-ai-framework):**
- Core AI physics models and simulation engines
- Process specifications and workflow templates
- Naming conventions and standards databases
- Heritage knowledge and reference datasets
- Framework evolution and release management

**Mission Repository (mission-specific-name):**
- Mission-specific instantiation of framework templates
- Requirements, design, and analysis artifacts following TT1.0 structure
- Configuration pointing to specific framework version
- Mission-unique knowledge base and lessons learned
- Flight-specific software and manufacturing instructions

### 3.2 Knowledge Evolution Framework
The architecture supports continuous improvement through structured knowledge transfer:

```
Framework Repository
    ↓ (provides initial conditions and templates)
Mission A, Mission B, Mission C...
    ↑ (contributes validated patterns and lessons learned)
Framework Repository (evolved version)
    ↓ (improved starting point for future missions)
Next Generation Missions
```

### 3.3 Framework Versioning and Mission Coupling
- Framework follows semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Missions specify framework dependency in `.framework-version` file
- Controlled upgrade paths with compatibility validation
- Automated dependency checking and conflict resolution

## 4. Version Control Strategy

### 4.1 Git Workflow Model
Adapted GitFlow model optimized for spacecraft development phases:

**Branch Hierarchy:**
- `main` - Current flight-ready baseline
- `develop` - Integration branch for next development phase
- `feature/*` - Individual requirements or design work
- `analysis/*` - Simulation and trade study branches
- `phase/*` - Major phase development (conceptual, detailed, validation)
- `hotfix/*` - Critical issue resolution

### 4.2 Phase-Based Branching Strategy
Branch management aligns with TT1.0 development phases and TPM progression:

**Conceptual Phase:** Feature branches for L1/L2 requirements and architecture trades
**Detailed Design Phase:** Analysis branches for L3 requirements and component sizing
**Virtual Validation Phase:** Integration branches for system validation and verification
**Proto-Flight Phase:** Release branches for flight baseline preparation

### 4.3 Commit and Review Standards
**Commit Message Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Types: req, design, analysis, config, docs, fix
- Scopes: subsystem identifiers (PWR, COMM, etc.)
- Automated validation against TT_1.5.1 naming conventions

**Review Requirements:**
- Requirements changes: Systems engineer approval + AI validation
- Critical design changes: Technical lead + peer review
- Phase transitions: Formal review board with TPM validation

## 5. Configuration Item (CI) Identification

### 5.1 CI Classification Framework
Configuration items are classified according to mission criticality and managed with appropriate rigor:

**Level 1 CIs (Mission-Critical):**
- L1 Requirements baseline and DRM specifications
- System architecture and master interface definitions
- Framework version dependencies and configurations
- Flight software baseline and over-the-air update packages

**Level 2 CIs (Subsystem-Critical):**
- L2/L3 Requirements by subsystem following TT_1.1 schema
- Subsystem design specifications and physics model implementations
- Interface control documents and standardized control protocols
- Manufacturing instructions and quality control procedures

**Level 3 CIs (Component-Level):**
- Component specifications and detailed interface definitions
- Analysis models, simulation scripts, and validation datasets
- Test procedures, acceptance criteria, and flight qualification data
- CAD models, drawings, and automated fabrication instructions

### 5.2 CI Identification and Tracking
CI identification follows TT_1.5.1 naming conventions with automated tracking through the software ecosystem. All CIs maintain bidirectional traceability to requirements, design decisions, and verification activities as defined in TT_1.5.6.

## 6. Baseline Management

### 6.1 Phase Baseline Definitions

### 6.2 Baseline Change Control
Post-baseline changes require formal change control with automated impact assessment across the software ecosystem. Change approval authority scales with baseline level and impact severity as defined in Section 7.

## 7. Change Control Processes
