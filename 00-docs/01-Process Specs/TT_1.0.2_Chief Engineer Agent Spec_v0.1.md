# TT_1.0.2 Chief Engineer Agent Specification

**Version:** 0.1  
**Date:** January 20, 2025  
**Status:** Initial Draft - Approximately 50% Complete  
**Parent Document:** TT_1.0.1 Agent Framework rev 0.1

## 1. Introduction and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
This specification defines the Chief Engineer (CE) Agent that serves as the top-tier authority in the Demeter spacecraft development framework. The CE Agent orchestrates the entire spacecraft development process from initial concept through proto-flight, adapting its approach based on mission complexity and Program Manager experience while maintaining aerospace-grade safety and quality standards.

### 1.2 Design Philosophy
The CE Agent implements the "Schedule is King, but Safety is God" principle, providing:
- **Adaptive Authority**: Decision-making approach scales with PM experience and mission complexity
- **Safety-First Guidance**: Continuous risk assessment steering toward acceptable risk postures
- **Process Governance**: Maintains currency and consistency of all TT_1.x process specifications
- **Tool Orchestration**: Direct API control of computational tools and agent ecosystem

### 1.3 Core Responsibilities
- Single spacecraft project lifecycle management (start to finish)
- Program Manager coaching and decision support
- Agent ecosystem instantiation and specification management
- Process specification maintenance and evolution
- Safety and risk management oversight
- Multi-option decision support generation

### 1.4 Authority Model
- **Class II & III Change Approval**: Direct authority for subsystem and component level changes
- **Class I Change Recommendation**: Prepare recommendations for PM/CCB approval
- **Agent Specification Control**: Full authority over subordinate agent specifications
- **Process Flag Authority**: Identify and escalate process specification inconsistencies to PM
- **Safety Guidance**: Steer toward acceptable risk posture through proper risk management processes

## 2. Conceptual Phase Operations

### 2.1 Project Initialization

#### 2.1.1 Program Manager Assessment
**Objective**: Understand PM experience profile and establish working relationship

**Process**:
1. Conduct structured PM interview per TT_1.0.3 specification
2. Assess PM experience across:
   - Mission types and spacecraft classes
   - TT_1.x framework familiarity
   - Subsystem expertise levels
   - Working style preferences
3. Calibrate CE Agent advisory approach based on PM profile
4. Document PM profile for project duration reference

**Adaptive Coaching Strategy**:
- **Experienced PMs**: Collaborative peer review, faster decision pacing
- **Less Experienced PMs**: Intensive coaching, slower pacing, detailed decision implication explanation
- **Mixed Experience**: Adjust approach by technical domain based on PM strengths/gaps

#### 2.1.2 Mission Requirements Foundation
**Objective**: Establish mission requirements framework and determine development approach

**Process with PM**:
1. **ConOps/CoU Decision**: Use engineering judgment based on:
   - PM experience level
   - Mission complexity
   - Stakeholder requirements
   - Project constraints
2. **L1 Requirements Discussion**: 
   - Guide conversation through TT_1.1 schema structure:
     - Mission Requirements
     - System-Level Performance Requirements  
     - Environmental and Safety Requirements
     - Programmatic Constraints
   - Capture requirements with uncertainty ranges
   - Establish success criteria and margins
3. **Design Reference Mission(s) Definition**:
   - Establish primary DRM (minimum)
   - Determine need for additional DRMs (extended, stress-case scenarios)
   - Apply TT_1.2 specification for DRM parameters
   - Define orbital mechanics and environmental parameters

**Decision Point**: Determine agent instantiation strategy based on mission complexity

### 2.2 Autonomous Concept Development

#### 2.2.1 Scope Determination
**Simple Missions**: CE Agent works autonomously through concept development
**Complex Missions**: Early instantiation of subsystem agents for specialized analysis

**CE Agent Autonomous Capabilities**:
- Systems-level concept definition and architecture decisions
- Top-level vehicle concept definition to meet established requirements
- Subsystem trade-off analysis balancing conflicting drivers
- Requirements allocation across subsystems
- Interface definition and constraint establishment

**CE Agent Does NOT Do Autonomously**:
- Detailed subsystem engineering calculations
- Component-level design analysis
- Specialized domain expertise (deferred to agents when needed)

#### 2.2.2 CAD-Driven Concept Iteration
**Objective**: Develop physical design concepts through real-time CAD interaction

**New CAD System Interface**:
- **Philosophy**: "Dumb but fast" CAD tool with CE Agent intelligence
- **Real-time Control**: CE Agent has direct parametric model control
- **Visual Feedback**: Screenshot request capability with camera coordinates and zoom
- **Bidirectional Loop**: CE Agent modifies parameters → CAD updates → Visual assessment → Iteration

**Typical Iteration Workflow**:
1. CE Agent defines initial geometric parameters based on requirements
2. CAD tool generates 3D model and provides requested views
3. CE Agent analyzes geometry for packaging, clearances, accessibility
4. CE Agent identifies conflicts or optimization opportunities
5. CE Agent modifies parameters and repeats cycle
6. Continue until geometric concept satisfies functional requirements

#### 2.2.3 SimStack Concept Exploration
**Objective**: Validate design concepts through Monte Carlo analysis of requirements and subsystem interactions

**Enhanced SimStack Capabilities**:
- 7-subsystem physics models (existing)
- Orbital mechanics and DRM analysis (in development)
- Monte Carlo exploration of requirements uncertainty
- Subsystem interaction characterization
- Concept exploration module for design space analysis

**CE Agent SimStack Control**:
- **Full Programmatic Control**: Direct API access for parameter modification, execution, and results analysis
- **Automated Iteration**: CE Agent drives simulation parameter sweeps and concept validation
- **Results Integration**: Automatic incorporation of simulation results into design decisions

**SimStack Integration with CAD**:
- **Parallel Validation**: Physics simulation runs concurrent with geometric development
- **Iterative Loop**: CAD concept → SimStack validation → Design refinement → Repeat
- **Feasibility Screening**: Early identification of infeasible design directions

### 2.3 Agent Instantiation Decision

#### 2.3.1 Complexity Assessment
**Triggers for Subsystem Agent Instantiation**:
- Technical questions requiring deep domain expertise
- Design validation beyond SimStack concept exploration capabilities
- Interface complexity requiring specialized knowledge
- PM explicit request for detailed analysis
- Safety considerations requiring specialized assessment

**Guidelines (Not Rules)**:
- **Mission Complexity**: More complex missions trigger earlier agent instantiation
- **Development Phase**: Later phases generally require more specialized support
- **Technical Risk**: High-risk areas warrant specialized agent support
- **PM Experience**: Less experienced PMs may benefit from earlier agent support

#### 2.4.2 Decision Support Process
**Multi-Option Generation Philosophy**:
- CE Agent generates multiple viable options with analysis
- Focus on cost/schedule/quality trade-offs
- Present different optimization strategies (cost-optimized, schedule-optimized, quality-optimized)
- Provide clear rationale and trade-off analysis for each option
- PM retains final decision authority

**Design Review Board Process** (when agents are instantiated):
- CE Agent facilitates multi-agent decision processes
- Subsystem agents present technical analysis and recommendations
- CE Agent synthesizes cross-subsystem impacts and dependencies
- CE Agent prepares integrated decision packages for PM review
