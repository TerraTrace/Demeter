## 4. Traceability and Linking

### 4.1 Parent/Child Relationships

Requirements traceability follows strict hierarchical rules to maintain clear decomposition paths from mission objectives to detailed implementation requirements. Each requirement must maintain links to its parent requirements (higher level) and child requirements (lower level).

**Mandatory Traceability Links:**
- Parent requirements (the higher-level requirements this derives from)
- Child requirements (the lower-level requirements derived from this)
- Derived requirements (related requirements at the same level)
- Verification links (connections to verification procedures and results)
- Design links (connections to design solutions and trade studies)

**Traceability Validation Rules:**
- All L2 requirements must trace to at least one L1 requirement
- All L3 requirements must trace to at least one L2 requirement
- No circular dependencies are permitted in the traceability chain
- Child requirements cannot exceed parent requirement constraints

### 4.2 Requirements Allocation Process

The requirements allocation process follows an iterative methodology driven by simulation feedback to ensure optimal resource distribution while maintaining adequate system reserves.

**Allocation Methodology Steps:**
1. **Initial Allocation**: Decompose L1 requirements to L2 based on functional architecture and historical data
2. **Simulation Analysis**: Execute subsystem simulations to validate allocation feasibility
3. **Allocation Refinement**: Adjust allocations based on simulation results and performance predictions
4. **Reserve Management**: Maintain system-level reserves for critical technical performance measures
5. **Iteration**: Repeat allocation-simulation cycles until convergence with adequate reserves

**Allocation Tracking Requirements:**
The allocation process requires tracking of parameter budgets through a structured approach that monitors initial estimates, current allocations, actual estimates from analysis, and remaining reserves. Each allocation change must be documented with rationale and supporting simulation or analysis references.

### 4.3 Allocation Tracking and Management

**Allocation Spreadsheet Structure:**
The allocation tracking system maintains the following information for each allocated parameter:
- Parameter name and units
- L1 system-level constraint
- Initial allocation estimates
- Current allocations based on latest analysis
- Actual estimates from simulation/analysis
- Remaining reserves (both absolute and percentage)
- Allocation change history with dates and rationale
- Supporting simulation or analysis references
- Risk assessment for each allocation

**Reserve Management Framework:**
System-level reserves are maintained for critical parameters with the following tracking:
- Target reserve percentages for each parameter type
- Minimum acceptable reserve thresholds
- Current reserve status and trends
- Risk assessment based on reserve levels
- Mitigation actions if reserves fall below thresholds

### 4.4 Simulation-Driven Allocation Updates

**Feedback Loop Process:**
The simulation-driven allocation process creates a continuous feedback loop where simulation results inform allocation adjustments:
- Simulation execution validates current allocations
- Performance predictions update allocation requirements
- Reserve impacts are assessed for each change
- Allocation history maintains traceability of changes
- Risk levels are updated based on allocation confidence

**Integration with TPM Tracking:**
Allocation updates directly feed into Technical Performance Measure tracking, ensuring that system-level performance predictions remain current as allocations evolve through the design process.

### 4.5 Cross-Reference Linking

Requirements maintain comprehensive links to all related project artifacts to enable full traceability and impact assessment:
- Design documents and architecture definitions
- Trade studies and analysis reports
- Simulation models and results
- Test procedures and results
- Applicable standards and specifications
- Heritage systems and lessons learned
- Interface control documents
- Verification and validation artifacts

## 5. Units and Conversions

The requirements system uses SI units as the primary standard with automatic conversion capabilities for common engineering units. The system supports unit validation to ensure appropriate units are used for each parameter type and provides reasonable range checking for typical spacecraft parameters.

## 6. Validation Rules

### 6.1 Data Consistency Validation

**Schema Compliance Checks:**
All requirements must pass basic data validation including mandatory field population, correct data types, valid enumerated values, reasonable numerical ranges, and proper naming convention compliance. Unique identifiers must follow the hierarchical naming pattern and be system-unique.

**Field-Specific Validation:**
Requirement IDs must follow the established naming conventions, requirement levels must be 1-4, status values must be from the approved list, risk levels must be Low/Medium/High, and units must be compatible with their parameter types.

### 6.2 Requirements Consistency Validation

**Hierarchy Consistency Checks:**
The validation system ensures proper parent-child relationships exist throughout the requirements hierarchy. All L2 requirements must trace to L1 parents, all L3 to L2 parents, and all L4 to L3 parents. No circular dependencies are permitted, and child requirements cannot exceed parent constraints. System-level allocation sums cannot exceed L1 constraints.

**Interface Consistency Validation:**
All interfaces must have matching requirements on both sides of the interface. Electrical voltages, mechanical geometries, and data protocols must be compatible between interfacing subsystems. All subsystem interactions must have properly defined interface requirements.

### 6.3 Simulation-Based Validation

**Performance Validation Thresholds:**
L2 requirements must be validated through subsystem simulation with 90% confidence for progression to Detailed Design phase. System-level TPM-1 (probability of meeting L1 requirements) must achieve 90% threshold, and TPM-2 (subsystem interaction characterization) must reach 85% completeness. Critical parameters must maintain minimum 10% design margins.

**System-Level Validation Requirements:**
Mission-level simulations must demonstrate 95% confidence for flight readiness. Subsystem interactions must be 100% characterized, critical couplings validated with 95% confidence, and 90% of identified failure modes must have coverage analysis.

**Reserve Validation Thresholds:**
System mass reserves must maintain minimum 5% with 15% target, power reserves minimum 10% with 20% target, and volume reserves minimum 5% with 10% target. All reserves must show stable or improving trends.

### 6.4 Phase Readiness Validation

**Conceptual to Detailed Design Transition:**
All L1 requirements must have complete L2 decomposition, 90% of provisional L3 requirements must be defined, L2 requirements must be 90% simulation-validated, 80% of critical subsystem interactions must be characterized, system reserves must exceed minimum thresholds, and architecture trade studies must be completed with documented rationale.

**Detailed Design to Virtual Validation Transition:**
All L3 requirements must be finalized and analysis-verified, 95% of L4 requirements must be defined for critical components, high-fidelity subsystem models must be 95% validated, TPM-1 must achieve 95% threshold, TPM-2 must achieve 100% characterization, component specifications must be 95% complete, and interface control documents must be 100% finalized.

**Virtual Validation to Proto-Flight Transition:**
Mission-level simulation campaigns must be completed for all scenarios, mission performance must be validated with 95% success probability, system risk assessment must be acceptable, 95% of critical failure modes must have mitigation, flight procedures must be 100% simulation-validated, and manufacturing/test plans must be complete.

### 6.5 Automated Validation Workflow

**Validation Triggers and Execution:**
The validation system automatically triggers on requirement modifications, simulation completions, and phase transition requests. The validation sequence progresses through schema compliance, hierarchy consistency, interface validation, allocation checking, simulation-based performance validation, and phase readiness assessment.

**Results Management:**
Validation results are categorized as Critical, High, Medium, Low, or Warning levels. Critical errors block phase transitions. The system provides automatic fixes for unit conversion and formatting issues, while allocation excess, interface mismatches, and performance shortfalls require manual engineering review. A real-time validation dashboard tracks status and maintains historical validation records.# kg
