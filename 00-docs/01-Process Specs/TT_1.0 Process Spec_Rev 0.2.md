## 3. Process Architecture

### 3.1 Development Philosophy
The AI-driven approach enables a fundamental shift from traditional "design-build-test-fix" cycles to accelerated "design-simulate-test-refine" cycles, supported by three pillars of software-centricity:

**Software-Driven Development Process:**
- Requirements, designs, and analyses managed as executable code
- AI workflows enable rapid iteration cycles (days/hours instead of weeks/months)
- Version control and DevOps practices ensure traceability and quality

**Software-Centric Vehicle Architecture:**
- Maximum spacecraft functionality implemented in software/CPU
- Standardized control interfaces minimize hardware complexity
- Software-defined capabilities enable post-deployment upgrades
- Simple, standardized end effectors reduce integration risk

**Automated Design-to-Manufacturing Pipeline:**
- AI design outputs drive parametric CAD model generation
- Automated CAD-to-fabrication with minimal human intervention
- Direct transition to proto-flight hardware, skipping traditional engineering models

This integrated approach allows for:
- **End-to-end automation**: From mission requirements to flight-ready hardware
- **Unprecedented iteration speed**: Software changes propagate through entire pipeline
- **Consistent quality**: Automated processes eliminate transcription errors
- **Scalable spacecraft production**: Mass customization through standardized interfaces

### 3.2 Phase Structure
The process is organized into four primary phases:

1. **Conceptual Phase**: Mission requirements to provisional L3 subsystem requirements
2. **Detailed Design Phase**: High-fidelity simulation and component specification
3. **Virtual Validation Phase**: Integrated system validation in simulation
4. **Proto-Flight Phase**: Direct to flight-ready hardware with flight testing

### 3.3 Technical Performance Measures (TPMs)
Two key metrics track progress and readiness:

- **TPM-1**: Probability of meeting Level 1 requirements (target: 90% for phase transition, >95% for flight)
- **TPM-2**: Subsystem interaction characterization completeness

### 3.4 Software-First Architecture Impact
This philosophy fundamentally changes spacecraft development by treating spacecraft as software platforms supported by standardized hardware interfaces:

**Configuration Management Impact:**
- Software-heavy CM practices manage the entire development ecosystem
- Version control spans from requirements through manufacturing instructions
- Automated traceability links design decisions to flight operations (detailed in **TT_1.5**)

**CAD Integration Impact:**
- Parametric models driven directly by AI design outputs
- Automated model generation eliminates manual CAD development
- Real-time design-manufacturing feedback loops (detailed in **TT_1.7**)

**Flight Software Impact:**
- Primary vehicle capability implementation through software
- Standardized hardware control interfaces enable rapid integration
- Over-the-air updates provide post-deployment capability enhancement (detailed in **TT_1.8**)

**Manufacturing Impact:**
- Automated fabrication pipeline from design parameters to flight hardware
- Consistent quality through elimination of manual processes
- Scalable production through standardized interfaces

**Operations Impact:**
- Software-defined mission capabilities allow mission evolution
- Standardized ground systems interfaces
- Rapid response to changing mission requirements through software updates

The existing process phases (Conceptual, Detailed Design, Virtual Validation, Proto-Flight) remain valid but are accelerated and enhanced through this software-first approach. Each phase leverages automated tools and standardized interfaces to reduce development time while maintaining aerospace-grade quality and traceability.
